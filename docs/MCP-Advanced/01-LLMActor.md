# 🧠 Module 1 – LLMActor

## 🎯 Goal

Replace the classic rule-based Actor of an MCP system with an LLM-based version that can interpret natural language input and return a valid `ActionType`.

---

## 🧱 What was built

- `LLMActor.ts`: Main class that builds a system prompt, sends it to a model (or mock), and validates the output.
- `mockLLM.ts`: A fake model that simulates responses to test logic without requiring an actual API.
- `LLMActor.test.ts`: Manual test script that verifies multiple inputs and shows clear pass/fail feedback.

---

## 🔍 Key Learnings

- How to design an **instructional prompt** that guides the LLM to return structured outputs.
- Why it's essential to **sanitize model output** before integrating it into a backend system.
- How to **mock a model** for local testing without depending on external services.
- How to manually validate model behavior with clear logging, without needing a test framework yet.

---

## ✅ Outcome

The `LLMActor` is now fully functional and can be plugged into any MCP workflow.  
The system passed all defined test cases with the mock model.

This component will evolve in future modules by connecting to a real LLM API and handling more complex behaviors.

---

## 📌 Notes

- The prompt and logic were manually crafted to reinforce understanding of LLM integration.
- This module was developed as part of the **Advanced MCP – Cognitive Agent Series**.

The next module will focus on **Prompt Engineering** and how to iterate and test instruction strategies for consistent model behavior.
